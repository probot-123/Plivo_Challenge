# Frontend Development Guidelines

## Basic Styling:
- Clean, minimalistic UI similar to Linear. You can use a framework like ShadcnUI

## Responsive Design
- Ensure the application adapts gracefully to various screen sizes using responsive design techniques (e.g., media queries or CSS frameworks like ShadcnUI/Tailwind).
- Optimize images and assets to improve load times on all devices.
- Test the UI on multiple devices and orientations.

## State Management
- Adopt a clear state management strategy (such as Redux, Vuex, or the Context API) to handle application state predictably.
- Keep local component state minimal and centralize the shared state where needed.
- Ensure state flows are unidirectional and easy to trace for debugging.

## Component Structure and Organization
- Build UI components that are modular and reusable.
- Follow atomic design principles by creating small, focused building blocks (atoms, molecules, organisms) that compose larger interfaces.
- Use proper component naming conventions and folder structures to improve maintainability.
