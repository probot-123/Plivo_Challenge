# Code Quality Guidelines

## Clean Code Practices
- Write code that is self-explanatory by using descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; strive for simplicity in your implementation.

## Documentation & Commenting
- Document the purpose and rationale behind complex logic and design decisions.
- Use inline comments sparingly; let the code be self-documenting where possible.
- Use structured documentation (such as JSDoc or docstrings) for public APIs and modules.

## Refactoring & Reusability
- Regularly refactor code to eliminate duplication (DRY principle).
- Break down large functions or classes into smaller, reusable, and focused units.
- Keep frequently used code in shared libraries or dedicated modules.
