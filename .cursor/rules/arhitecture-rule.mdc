# Architectural Guidelines

## Separation of Concerns
- Divide the application into clear layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).
- Avoid mixing UI code with business logicâ€”each module should have a single, clear responsibility.
- Implement design patterns (such as MVC, MVVM, or Clean Architecture) where they add clarity.

## Scalability & Maintainability
- Design modules to be independently testable, deployable, and maintainable.
- Use dependency injection and inversion of control to reduce tight coupling between components.
- Document high-level architecture decisions and update them as the project evolves.

## Future-Proofing
- Anticipate growth by choosing frameworks and tools known for scalability.
- Maintain abstraction barriers that can be refactored as your needs change.
- Plan for extensibility by designing clear interfaces between components.
