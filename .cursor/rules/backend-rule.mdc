# Backend Development Guidelines

## User and team management feature
- Use SaaS tools like Auth0/Clerk

## API Design
- Design RESTful APIs (or GraphQL endpoints where appropriate) with consistency.
- Document API endpoints thoroughly using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
- Implement versioning to facilitate backward compatibility as the API evolves.

## Database Integration
- Use ORMs or query builders to streamline database operations and reduce boilerplate.
- Apply normalization principles and define clear data schemas for database consistency.
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and transaction management to ensure data integrity.

## Authentication & Security
- Implement secure authentication and authorization methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
- Enforce strict input validation and follow best practices for storing sensitive data.
- Audit your security measures regularly and use industry-standard encryption methods.
